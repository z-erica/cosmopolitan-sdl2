Local changes:
 - imgui_example.cpp is taken from example_sdl2_opengl3, and is modified
   to use the vendored gl3w instead of imgui_impl_opengl3_loader.h
 - imgui_impl_opengl3.c (as imgui_impl_opengl3.inc) is compiled as part
   of imgui_example.cpp, so it has access to the gl procedure definitions
   even with IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM
 - SDL_cosmo.h include and SDL_CosmoInit call added to imgui_example.cpp
